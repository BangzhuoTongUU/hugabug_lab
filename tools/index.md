## Q: What is cluster? What is local? What is remote?

A: A computer cluster is a set of computers that work together so that they can be viewed as a single system. Local normally refers to your personal computer. If you're using a Mac then local refers to your Mac computer, if you're using windows then local refers to your windows computer. While remote normally refers to a computer cluster that is located far away from you. And you could get access to the remote by logging in with your user account/password on that cluster and do computational intensive work.
